Thanks words in Nobel Prize by Dr. Sheldon Lee Cooper:

Thank you Dr. Fellower.
I have a very long and somewhat self-centered speech here.
But I'd like to set it aside.
Because this honor doesn't just belong to me.
<!-- more -->
I wouldn't be up here if it weren't for some very important people in my life.
Beginning with my mother, father, meemaw, brother and sister.
And my other family who I'm so happy to have here with us.
I was under a misapprehension that my accomplishments were mine alone.
Nothing to be further from the truth.
I have ben encouraged, sustained, inspired and tolerated not only by my wife, but by the greatest group of friends anyone ever had.
I'd like to ask them to stand.
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.
Dr. Bernadeette Rostenkowsi Wolowitz.
Astronaut Howard Wolowitz.
And my two dearest friends in the world,
Penny Hofstadter
and
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
I was there the moment Leonard and Penny met.
He said to me that their babies would smart and beautiful.
And now that they're expecting, I have no doubt that that will be the case.

Howard, Bernadette,Raj, Penny, Leonard,
I apologize if I haven't been the friend you deserve.
But I want you to know in my way, I love you all. And I love you.
Thank you.

2007年到2019年, 12年时间. 没有TBB一直陪伴着.
曾经的, 过去的, 都开始要离去了.
钢铁侠老了, 谢耳朵老了.

再见了.
